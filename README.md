# Balloon-Jumper
I made this project as a submission for my project for Computer Graphics.

Balloon Jumper is a simple 2D game developed using OpenGL. The objective of the game is to control a character jumping from a hot air balloon and land safely on a designated landing area.


Features
Intuitive controls: Use the spacebar to jump from the balloon.
Dynamic gameplay: The landing area decreases in size as you progress, increasing the difficulty.
Score tracking: Keep track of your score and aim for the highest score possible.
Lives system: You have a limited number of lives. Be careful not to miss the landing area!
Installation
To run Balloon Jumper on your machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/balloon-jumper.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory: 
```bash
cd balloon-jumper
```

Compile the source code using a compatible compiler (e.g., g++):
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o balloon_jumper -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lm
```

Run the executable:

```

Controls
Spacebar: Jump from the balloon to initiate the character's descent.
